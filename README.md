## What is Imba

Imba is a programming language for building web applications. While Imba provides the most benefits on the client side, it is a full stack language that you can use on the server as well.

The two main benefits to Imba are:

* Its beautiful syntax and programming philosophy opens up new and efficient ways to build web applications. 
* Compatible with the existing JavaScript. Not only does Imba compile down to hyper-efficient JavaScript but it also can import and use existing npm modules.

### What Imba is not

Imba is not a framework. It does not define the application design process and paradigm for building web applications. While Imba makes state management super easy, you have to pick your approach.

### How does Imba do this?

In Imba, DOM elements are first-class citizens. Your {declarative} {Views} are compiled to an inline DOM. That is what leads to the 20x performance increase above the virtual DOM implementations.

New Version of Intro:

### What is Imba

Imba is a language for building fast web applications. Thought it can use a State management system, it does not require one. Your Imba app will be compiled into JavaScript at build time, and will be plain vanilla JavaScript ready to run on the browser. This gives you a performance edge over languages and frameworks that need to be interpreted at run time.

You can build apps, front-end to backend with Imba as it is with scrimba.com, but you may also add it incrementally to your existing code base. You also use Imba to build standalone components and modules that work anywhere JavaScript does, and they will not require any bulky dependencies.

### What is this tutorial

You will need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, since those are the languages that Imba builds with behind the scenes. Familiarity with other web frameworks and other languages like JavaScript and ruby will surely be helpful in the programming concepts of Imba, but the aim of this tutorial is to help you build web apps with Imba and with no prior knowledge of any other programming language.

### Understanding Components

Imba facilitates a component based web app architecture, where you can create reusable self-contained blocks of code into separate Imba files.
