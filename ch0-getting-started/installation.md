# Installing Imba

The easiest way to get started with Imba is to use the [official template](https://github.com/imba/imba2-hello-world), see the [Getting Started](get-started.md) page on how to get it. If you are using Webpack, other bundlers or just want to manually run stuff then you can install Imba this way:

```text
yarn global add imba@pre # npm -g install imba@pre
```

### Troubleshooting

If you end up with some kind of error message, make sure you have a recent [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version installed.

```text
node --version
```



* [ ] TODO\(alexander\): Remove `@pre` when Imba v2 has been released
